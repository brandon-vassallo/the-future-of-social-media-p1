    <p>  In 2015, an artist named Richard Prince produced large prints of Instagram Photo screenshots and distplayed them in an art gallery, calling the exhibity New Portraits. This exhibition started reaching notable fame and then criticism once paintings started ceiling for nearly $100,000 at the Frieze Art Fair New York. while he debated that he modified it by displaying the comments he added to them, these art works stirred up quite a controversy as to the questioning of copyright infringement. Although no official court hearring has been held reguarding this issue, Richard Prince has fought many cases like this in the past only to come out on top, such as in 2011 when he slithered around a lawsuit for using photos without permission or licensing in his book <i> Yes Rasta </i> by claiming to transform the originals. With his track record, it wouldnt be outlandish to assume that he would come out on top with any lawsuits against this gallery - if he ever gets a lawsuit that is. </p>

        <p>  I don't have a definitive solution for this issue, but I do believe it is important that social media websites can protect their users. It shouldn't be so easy or socially accepted that a famous artist can steal someone's photos and get away with them. I understand that these people have their profiles publicly displayed, but it shouldn't make them the subject of exploitation by people with more money than those who are exploited.</p>
